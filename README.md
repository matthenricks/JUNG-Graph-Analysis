JUNG Graph Analysis CCB

This project was created to run a series of calculations and analyses for testing if Graph measures maintain similar properties sampled as their parents. In order to test this, we looked into (In/Out)Degree, BC, and LLC on Erdos, Baribasi, and Snap datasets, measuring the correlation, retrieval, and distribution shape of those measures.
